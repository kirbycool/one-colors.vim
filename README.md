# one-colors.vim, yet another one-dark colorscheme

This a vim approximation of the Atom editor's [one-dark](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax) colorscheme. It's built using the [RNB](https://github.com/romainl/vim-rnb) colorscheme template.

I've tried to stay as true to the original Atom colorscheme as possible, while also keeping the vim highlights lightweight (you wont find any plugin specific hightlight groups here).

Currently this only supports one-dark, but will eventually also include the companion [one-light](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-light-syntax) colorscheme.
